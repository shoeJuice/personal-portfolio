    "The projects I've worked on have given me the opportunity to learn a wide variety of technologies. \
    My stack relies heavily on React and NextJS, and many of my front-end projects use ChakraUI for styling. \
    Other libraries and frameworks I have used include Redux, Jest, Storybook, and Framer-Motion among many others \
    and I am always looking to learn more.",
  languagesTitle: "Languages",
  languagesDesc: "I have a strong background in Python, where it has been used \
  as a primary language of instruction in my university courses. \
  I have used Python in tandem with React to build one of my \
  first full-stack projects. While Python is one of my strongest \
  languages, I otherwise have a strong understanding of \
  Javascript and Typescript. Other languages I have experience \
  with include Java and C++.",
